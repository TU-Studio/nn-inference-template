#  Neural Network Inference Template for Real-Time Audio Processing

![mockup](assets/graphics/mockup.png)

This repository provides a comprehensive template and practical guide for implementing neural network inference within real-time audio processing environments. For this, we utilize three common inference engines: TensorFlow Lite, LibTorch, and ONNX Runtime.

It covers crucial aspects of maintaining real-time safety and ensuring a seamless signal flow. We delve into the delicate balance between latency, performance, and stability.
